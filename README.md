   **Full Stack ML application**
   
      1.  Collect dataset
      2.  Model dataset
      3.  Build Applcation
      4.  Deploy Application
      
      
   **Collect dataset**
      
      - Need images of food or not food
      
          -   For images of not food : download random images from imageNet
          -   or images of food : random subset of images from food101
     
   **Model dataset**
   
      -  Build a computer vision model to classify food and not food
      
   **Build Application**
   
      -  Simple html with javascript
